Manually Sort Folders
=====================

Tested on:  

Windows 10 x64 with eaMonkey 2.53.10.2 (email accounts only)  

NOT tested:  

All other setups  


This extension for SeaMonkey 2+ adds a “Manually sort folders” entry into
the Tools menu. Use it to, hum, manually sort your accounts and folders (that was obvious,
wasn’t it?).
