-- v0.6 development series --

New bugfix with collapsing folders by default. Fix appearance of the tree.

-- v1.1.2b --

Fixed some JS compatibilty problems with Thunerbird 60 (mainly about Application
preference interfaces and restart). UI for account sorting works, folder sorting
is still broken, but writing to folder sort preference is inhibited so we don't
risk destroying existing sort order. Also using "pretty names" instead of
"prettiest names" as the latter is deprecated and in practice identical to the
first.
